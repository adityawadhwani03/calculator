The task is to create a responsive calculator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used my HTML and CSS skills to build the basic structure and design of the site. To add functionality, I incorporated JavaScript, which helped me to create a dynamic and interactive calculator. This task provided an excellent introduction to web development and helped me to refine my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
